# Big Red App for iOS

Yes, this is the iOS version of [Genki Marshall's](https://github.com/genkimarshall) [Big Red App](https://github.com/genkimarshall/bigredapp-android). As such, its goals are very similar.
 
## What
* It's still a pain to find Cornell University dining hall info on the phone...
* So, this is a native iOS app to help people do that :)
* We are using [Kevin Chavez](https://github.com/mrkev)'s API [here](http://redapi-tious.rhcloud.com/).

## Objectives
* Free and open source.
* Native iOS app: easy to use, good looking, minimal, clean.
* Code: well-commented and easy to maintain.

## Contributing
* [Pull requests](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project) are very welcome! Do not hesitate if you are a beginner--we all have to learn at some point.
