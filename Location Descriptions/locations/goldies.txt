a café in the Physical Science Building


Welcome to Goldie's. Conveniently located in the new Physical Sciences Building on central campus, Goldie's is a treat for breakfast, lunch, or a snack.

For breakfast, try our homemade breakfast sandwiches and a Starbucks specialty coffee. For lunch, our signature sandwiches – some served on German-style pretzel rolls – have become customer favorites, and a wide array of Freshtake Grab-n-Go items, snacks, and desserts are always on the menu.
