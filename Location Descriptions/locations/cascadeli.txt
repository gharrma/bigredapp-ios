a café/deli in Willard Straight Hall


Named after the beautiful Cascadilla Gorge running through campus, Cascadeli is a café and deli located on the main floor of Willard Straight Hall.  

Enjoy made-to-order deli sandwiches, hot daily soups, salads, and desserts. Cascadeli also now offers Cornell Street Cart Hot Dogs year 'round! If the weather's nice, our balcony offers the most picturesque place to eat on campus, with distant views of the lake and hills.
