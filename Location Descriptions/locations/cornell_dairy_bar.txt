a caf√© featuring Cornell Dairy items in Stocking Hall


In the beautifully renovated Stocking Hall on the east end of Tower Road, the Cornell Dairy Bar is a great place for breakfast, lunch, coffee, or a sweet treat. We offer Cornell Dairy ice cream, milk, yogurt, pudding, and Big Red Cheddar, produced right here at Cornell's very own dairy processing plant. 

The Dairy Bar offers Finger Lakes Coffee Roasters specialty coffees, a mouth-watering array of sandwiches made to order, grab-and-go FreshTake items, and even pints of ice cream to take with you. Please note that our fresh deli counter is open 10:30-4:00 Monday through Friday, and ice cream service begins at 10:30am. FreshTake sandwiches and packaged salads and ice cream items are available in our cooler outside those hours.

Our regular hours vary seasonally, especially weekend hours, so please check the specific hours on this page for updates.
