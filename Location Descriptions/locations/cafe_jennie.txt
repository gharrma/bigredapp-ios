a café and sandwich/pastry shop in The Cornell Store


Café Jennie is named for Jennie McGraw, the daughter of John McGraw, a wealthy industrialist and a founding Cornell Trustee. Upon her death in 1881, she left the majority of her estate to Cornell. Funds were used to purchase the chimes for the library, establish an endowment for a student hospital, and build an addition to Sage Chapel. Jennie's generosity and love of Cornell moved us to name the café at the Cornell Store for her.

Stop by for a warm cup of Peet's Coffee & Tea beverages, delicious Cheesecake Factory baked goods, or a mouth-watering array of sandwiches and wraps designed just for Café Jennie. Remember, you can use your Big Red Bucks to save on food and beverages at Café Jennie!


Join us in the morning for Steel Cut Oatmeal, Chobani Greek Style Yogurt, or Chorizo or a Vegetable Frittata Bagel Sandwich. Pop by at lunchtime for one of our creative new sandwiches and wraps, like Beef Brisket, Roasted Vegetable Focaccia, or Thai Chicken. Or visit any time for brewed coffee or tea or an espresso beverage made with Peet's Coffee.
