a café and graduate/professional student community center


Once a carriage house, the Big Red Barn is now a cozy café with a delicious breakfast and lunch menu.  It also serves as Cornell's on-campus social center for graduate and professional students.

Enjoy an omelet wrap and hot specialty coffee for breakfast, a Sicilian Pasta Bake for lunch, or a Freshtake Grab-n-Go salad or packaged Kosher dish if you're in a hurry. Vegan pasta bakes and pizzas are now available, featuring Daiya mozzarella. Relax outdoors at our picnic tables, or sit inside by the fireplace in our comfortable lounge furniture.

The Big Red Barn's eatery is open to the whole Cornell community for breakfast and lunch, Monday through Friday. The Graduate and Professional Student Center staff provides snacks and beverages to graduate and professional students on afternoons and evenings, and hosts numerous events and programs throughout the academic year.
